# Remaining Tasks Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed
1. Repository created and pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1
2. All branches pushed: main, dev, stage
3. All workflows configured and fixed
4. CODEOWNERS updated with @k2d22h

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Add 4 Collaborators (Required)
**Manual step on GitHub:**
1. Go to https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/settings/access
2. Click "Invite a collaborator" or "Add people"
3. Add 4 users total (including yourself)
   - Enter their GitHub usernames
   - They will receive email invitations
   - Make sure to accept the invitations

### 2. Configure Branch Protection for `main` (Required)
**Manual step on GitHub:**
1. Go to https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/settings/branches
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable these settings:
   - ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Restrict who can push to matching branches** (select only 1 user)
   - ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
5. Click "Create"

### 3. Create Release v1.0.0 (Required)
**Run these commands locally:**

```powershell
# Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and push the tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Builds the artifact (scan-app-1.0.0.zip)
- Generates SBOM (sbom.spdx.json)
- Signs with Cosign (keyless)
- Creates GitHub Release v1.0.0 with all artifacts

**Check results:**
- Go to https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/releases
- Verify v1.0.0 release was created
- Download and verify artifacts are present

### 4. Check Security Scans (Required)
**Manual step on GitHub:**

1. **OpenSSF Scorecard:**
   - Go to https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/actions
   - Find "OpenSSF Scorecard" workflow run
   - View results or download artifacts

2. **Grype SBOM Scan:**
   - Go to https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/actions
   - Find "Grype SBOM Scan" workflow run
   - Review the scan output for vulnerabilities
   - Download SBOM artifact

3. **Fix any issues found** (if needed)

### 5. Documentation Submission
Make sure these files are complete:
- ‚úÖ README.md (with algorithm)
- ‚úÖ requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Makefile
- ‚úÖ steps.txt (all steps documented)
- ‚úÖ All workflows in .github/workflows/
- ‚úÖ All docs in docs/

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Repository is currently PUBLIC** - all data is visible
2. If you need to make it private, go to Settings ‚Üí Change visibility
3. Make sure collaborators accept their invitations before testing PR flow
4. Branch protection ensures code quality through PR workflow
5. All workflows are configured to run automatically

## üêõ If Something Goes Wrong

### Workflows not running?
- Check: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Workflow permissions
- Verify GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository

### Can't push to main?
- This is correct behavior if branch protection is enabled
- Use Pull Requests instead: push to dev/stage, then PR to main

### Cosign signing fails?
- Check Actions logs for error details
- May need to wait for workflow to complete
- Verify permissions include `id-token: write`

### Can't add collaborators?
- Make sure you're the repository owner
- Check if you have proper GitHub permissions

**Status:** Repository is live and ready for configuration
**Next Action:** Add collaborators and configure branch protection
