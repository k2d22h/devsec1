## Fixes Applied

### OpenSSF Scorecard Permissions Fix
**Problem:** Scorecard workflow was failing with error:
```
global perm is set to write: permission for security-events is set to write
```

**Root Cause:** OpenSSF Scorecard has workflow restrictions that prohibit certain permissions at the top level.

**Solution:** Moved `security-events: write` permission from top-level to job-level.

**Before:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write  # ‚ùå Not allowed at top level
  id-token: write

jobs:
  analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      ...
```

**After:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write  # ‚úÖ Allowed at job level
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    steps:
      ...
```

**Status:** Fixed and pushed. Waiting for next workflow run to verify.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. ‚úÖ Fix Scorecard permissions - **DONE**
2. ‚è≥ Wait for Scorecard workflow to verify fix
3. üîç Investigate "Build, Sign, and Release" installation failure
4. üîß Re-run failed "Build, Sign, and Release" workflow

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. Add LICENSE file (Scorecard detected missing)
2. Add SECURITY.md file (Scorecard detected missing)
3. Consider pinning dependencies by hash
4. Address vulnerabilities found by Grype

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. Add Dependabot for dependency updates
2. Set up code review requirements
3. Add fuzzing tests
4. Apply for OpenSSF Best Practices badge

## Workflow Triggers

### Automatic
- **Grype SBOM Scan**: On push to main/dev/stage OR PR to main ‚úÖ
- **Scorecard**: On push to main/dev/stage OR weekly schedule ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Build, Sign, Release**: On push of tag v* ‚ùå

### Manual
- All workflows can be re-run from Actions tab
- Scorecard and Grype can be triggered by pushing changes

## Checking Status

**GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/actions

**Re-run workflows:** Click on failed workflow ‚Üí "Re-run failed jobs"

**View logs:** Click on any step to see detailed logs

## Dependencies

All workflows use Ubuntu latest runners with:
- Syft: v1.14.0 (Grype) / v1.4.1 (local test)
- Cosign: Latest from install script
- Grype: v0.82.0
- Scorecard: v5.0.0
- Python: 3.11

## Notes

- Branch protection is configured for `main` but Scorecard still shows it as not protected (may need time to sync)
- Repository is new (< 90 days) so some Scorecard checks are marked as N/A
- All workflows have been configured with proper permissions now
- Release workflow needs investigation - installation scripts may have changed
