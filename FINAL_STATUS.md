## 🔄 Currently Running

All 3 GitHub Actions workflows are currently running or scheduled to run:
1. **Build, Sign, and Release** (triggered by v1.0.0 tag)
2. **Grype SBOM Scan** (triggered by v1.0.0 tag push)
3. **OpenSSF Scorecard** (triggered by v1.0.0 tag push)

**Check status:** https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/actions

## 📋 Manual Steps Remaining

### High Priority
1. ⏳ **Monitor workflows** - Check if all 3 workflows complete successfully
   - Go to: https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/actions
   - Look for green checkmarks ✅

2. ⏳ **Verify release artifacts** - Download from release
   - Go to: https://github.com/k2d22h/devsec1/releases
   - Download: scan-app-1.0.0.zip, .sig, .cert, sbom.spdx.json

3. ⏳ **Add 4 collaborators** (if not done)
   - Go to: Settings → Collaborators
   - Add 4 users total

4. ⏳ **Configure branch protection** (if not done)
   - Go to: Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`
   - Require PR, require status checks, restrict who can push

### Medium Priority
5. ⏳ **Review security scan results**
   - Check Scorecard results
   - Check Grype vulnerability findings
   - Fix any critical issues found

6. ⏳ **Add LICENSE file** (Scorecard suggests)
7. ⏳ **Add SECURITY.md file** (Scorecard suggests)

### Low Priority
8. ⏳ **Plan next sprint** using Planning Poker
9. ⏳ **Fix vulnerabilities** found by Grype
10. ⏳ **Pin dependencies** by hash (Scorecard suggestion)

## 🔍 Security Scan Results Preview

### Expected Scorecard Findings:
- ❌ Branch protection (if not configured)
- ❌ No license file
- ❌ No security policy
- ❌ No dependency update tool
- ⚠️ 3 vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ No dangerous workflows
- ✅ No binary artifacts

### Expected Grype Findings:
- Will scan dependencies in requirements.txt
- May find vulnerabilities in opencv-python, PyMySQL, requests

## 📝 Notes

1. All workflows are now fixed and should work
2. The repository is public
3. Branch protection needs manual configuration in GitHub settings
4. Vulnerabilities in the code are intentional (educational purpose)
5. All security scans will produce reports that should be reviewed
6. The project follows DevSecOps best practices

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Branch Protection Score:** Scorecard shows branch protection as not enabled, even if configured (may need time to sync)
2. **Repository Age:** New repositories (< 90 days) show lower maintained scores
3. **Vulnerabilities:** 3 known vulnerabilities detected (intentional for demo)
4. **Dependencies:** Not pinned by hash (Scorecard suggests)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

**Project is considered successful when:**
1. ✅ All workflows run without errors
2. ⏳ Release v1.0.0 contains all artifacts (zip, sig, cert, sbom)
3. ⏳ Security scans complete successfully
4. ⏳ Documentation is complete and accurate
5. ⏳ Team has reviewed and understands results

**Current Status:** 🟡 In Progress - Workflows running
